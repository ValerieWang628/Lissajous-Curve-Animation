# Lissajous-Curve-Animation
This animation python file is one extra work outside my CMU-15112 coursework.
I saw Daniel Shiffman realizing the curve animation through Processing,
so I created this animation using some fresh skills I learnt from 15112.

Also, the lissajous.py file is just a basic realization of the curve animation.
Later, more adjustments can be made. For example, adding keypressed/mousepressed features to add/release an extra circle, adjusting point orbiting speed, etc.
